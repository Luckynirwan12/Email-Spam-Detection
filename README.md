# 📩 Email Spam Detection using NLP & Streamlit

This is an end-to-end **Email/SMS Spam Detection** project using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. The model classifies a message as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** based on its content.

---

## 📥 How to Get the Dataset
We used the SMS Spam Collection dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can download it from here:

🔗 UCI SMS Spam Dataset

After downloading:

1. Extract the file if needed.

2. Rename it to spam.csv and place it in your project root directory (or wherever your code is loading it from).

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
Before training the model, we cleaned the raw dataset using the following steps:

### 🔻 Dropping Unnecessary Columns

- The original dataset has some unnamed or metadata columns (like Unnamed: 2, Unnamed: 3, etc.)

- We dropped all irrelevant columns and kept only:

   - v1 (Label: spam/ham)

   - v2 (Message)

### 🧯 Removing Duplicates

- Removed any duplicate messages to prevent data leakage or bias in the model.

### 🔄 Renaming Columns
- Renamed:

  - v1 ➝ target

  - v2 ➝ text

### 🔢 Encoding Labels
- Converted the target column to numerical:

  - ham ➝ 0

  - spam ➝ 1

## ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

- Preprocesses raw text using:
  - Lowercasing
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword removal
  - Stemming
- Converts text to numerical data using **TF-IDF**
- Predicts message as Spam or Ham using **Naive Bayes**
- Real-time web interface built with **Streamlit**
- Displays:
  - Prediction result ✅🚨
  - Confidence level
  - Transformed text for learning/debugging
